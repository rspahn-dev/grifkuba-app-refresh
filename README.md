# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Mobile Companion

Explore the `mobile/` directory for an Expo-powered React Native build that reuses the same mock wiki data, including native tabs for tickets and socials.

### Run the mobile app

1. `cd mobile`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`
4. Open Expo Go (SDK 54 or newer) and scan the QR code, or press `a` / `i` to launch Android or iOS simulators.

> The `npm run start` script uses the modern `@expo/cli` in offline mode. If the default port is busy, append `-- --port 8090` (for example) when running the command.
